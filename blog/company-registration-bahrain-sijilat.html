          <p class="text-xl text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-8">Bahrain has positioned itself as one of the most business-friendly jurisdictions in the Gulf region. The Kingdom's streamlined company registration process through the Sijilat portal makes it possible to establish a business entity within days. This guide walks you through every step of the process.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Understanding Sijilat</h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Sijilat is the online commercial registration portal operated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC). Launched as part of Bahrain's digital transformation initiative, it consolidates all business registration services into a single platform, allowing entrepreneurs to register companies, obtain licenses, and manage their commercial registrations entirely online.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Types of Business Entities in Bahrain</h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Before registering, you must select the appropriate legal structure for your business:</p>
          
          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">With Limited Liability Company (WLL)</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">The most common structure for small to medium businesses. Requires minimum two shareholders (can be individuals or corporate entities) and minimum capital of BD 20,000 for companies with foreign shareholders, or BD 50 for fully Bahraini-owned companies. Shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Single Person Company (SPC) - Discontinued</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Note: The Single Person Company structure has been discontinued in Bahrain. Sole entrepreneurs seeking limited liability protection should now consider forming a WLL with a trusted partner or exploring other available structures. Contact us for guidance on the best alternative for your situation.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Branch of a Foreign Company</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Foreign companies can establish a branch in Bahrain to conduct business. The branch is not a separate legal entity—the parent company remains fully liable for its operations. Requires a local service agent for certain activities.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Bahraini Shareholding Company (BSC)</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Suitable for larger enterprises. Can be closed (BSC Closed) or public (BSC Public). Minimum capital of BD 250,000 for closed companies and BD 1,000,000 for public companies. Requires minimum three founders.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Step-by-Step Registration Process</h2>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 1: Reserve Your Company Name</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Log into Sijilat (sijilat.bh) and submit a name reservation request. The name must be unique, not misleading, and comply with MOIC naming guidelines. Arabic names are required; English translations are optional. Name reservation is valid for 60 days and costs BD 10.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 2: Prepare Required Documents</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">For a WLL, you will typically need: valid CPR/passport copies of all shareholders, memorandum and articles of association (drafted and notarized), proof of registered address in Bahrain, bank reference letters for foreign shareholders, and board resolution if a corporate shareholder is involved.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 3: Draft Constitutional Documents</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">The Memorandum of Association (MOA) and Articles of Association (AOA) must be prepared in Arabic and notarized. These documents specify the company's name, capital, shareholders, business activities, management structure, and profit distribution. We strongly recommend engaging a lawyer to draft these documents to ensure compliance and protect shareholders' interests.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 4: Submit Application on Sijilat</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Complete the online application form, upload all required documents, and select your business activities from the MOIC activity list. Pay the registration fees online. The system will route your application to relevant authorities for approval.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 5: Obtain Commercial Registration (CR)</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Once approved, your Commercial Registration certificate is issued electronically. This typically takes 1-3 working days for straightforward applications. Some activities may require additional approvals from regulatory bodies (CBB for financial services, NHRA for healthcare, etc.), which can extend the timeline.</p>

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl text-navy mt-8 mb-3">Step 6: Post-Registration Requirements</h3>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">After obtaining your CR, you must: open a corporate bank account, register with the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) if hiring employees, register for VAT if applicable (threshold BD 37,500 annual turnover), and obtain any sector-specific licenses required for your activities.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Registration Fees</h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Fees vary based on company type and activities. As a general guide: name reservation costs BD 10, CR registration for a WLL ranges from BD 100-300 depending on activities, and annual CR renewal is approximately BD 50-150. Additional fees apply for notarization, municipal licenses, and sector-specific permits.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">100% Foreign Ownership</h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Bahrain allows 100% foreign ownership in most business sectors without requiring a local partner. Exceptions exist in certain regulated industries such as real estate ownership, press and publishing, and some professional services. This makes Bahrain particularly attractive for international entrepreneurs and investors.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Common Challenges and How to Avoid Them</h2>
          <p class="text-navy/70 leading-relaxed mb-6">Many applications face delays due to: incomplete documentation, activity codes that require special approvals, improper MOA/AOA drafting, or address verification issues. Working with experienced legal counsel helps navigate these challenges and ensures first-time approval.</p>

          <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-12 mb-4">Why Choose Sahwan Law</h2>
